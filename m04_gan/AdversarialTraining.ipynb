    "Note that the generator does not look at the training data at all. Instead it learns to map $(\\textbf{z}^{(i)})$ into a distribution that looks similar to $p_{\\text{data}}(\\textbf{x})$ by maximizing the discriminator's probability to respond positively to the generator's output $G(\\textbf{z}^{(i)})$. The term inside of the log is not the same as the false negative cost for the discriminator. This adjustment increases the magnitude of the gradient when the generator's samples are bad (e.g. $D$ is almost always 0).\n",
